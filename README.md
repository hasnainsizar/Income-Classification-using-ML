# CS178 Project – Adult Income Classification

This repository contains our COMPSCI 178 project, which uses the UCI **Adult** dataset to predict whether a person earns more than \$50K per year based on demographic and work-related features.

We load the dataset programmatically using the ucimlrepo.
pip install ucimlrepo, so no manual CSV download is required.
